		Here at Gamestore. We connect people who want to buy or sell video games. Once you signup and login, you'll
		be directed to a dashboard for your intent.
		<br><br>
		And, we're not GameStop. We'll actually ensure our customer driven market gets the value per game that they
		deserve, whether buying or selling.
		<br><br>
		Head on over to our team page or services to see who we are and what we truly have to offer.
