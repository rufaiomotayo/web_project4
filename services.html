			Let's talk. You've just run out of games to play. The library's empty and desolate.
			<br><br>
			Come buy a game. All you need to enter is your credit card info and you should find a catalog of games!
			<br><br>
			Or, you've finished a really good game. Now, you want someone else to have that wonderful experience.
			<br><br>
			We make selling easy too. We only need your personal information for shipping. After that, just put your
			game up for sell!
